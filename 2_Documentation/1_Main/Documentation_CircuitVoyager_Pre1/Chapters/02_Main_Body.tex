\subsubsection{Cost}
I've already bought two \acs{devboard}s one of them stays at \acs{tbz} and the other is at home. One of these boards was paid by Mr. Malacarne. Further expenses from the \acs{pcb} will be paid by me and shouldn't exceed about 50 CHF, as the \acs{hw} isn't that complicated.

\subsubsection{Time}
The most time of the project I will work at home because it's a rather big project to execute in one semester. I will also have much time in the fall holidays to work on it. The project will approximately take 100h to complete. Also the more detailed timeplan is in chapter: [\ref{sec:GANTT Chart}]

\subsubsection{Tools}
To realize this project I will mainly use, the \acs{sw} STM32CubeIDE with \acs{hal} and Altium Designer. The documentation is written in LaTeX in VSCode. And I'm planning to order the \acs{pcb} on JLCPCB and I will populate and reflow the PCB at ETHZ, where I'm also allowed to use the measurement equipment for the HW tests.
