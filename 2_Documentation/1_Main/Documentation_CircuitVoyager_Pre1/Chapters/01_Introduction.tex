The goal of this project is to develop a tiny extension Board for the STM32H747i-Disco Board, to allow it to act as a \acs{dmm}. Additionally, a \acs{sw}, that measures the \acs{dmm} Values and displays them on the Touch Display. If there's more time I could extend the Project with Measurement Logging via a SD-Card or over USB to a Desktop application.
\\
I want to learn how to implement high speed protocols such as \acs{mipidsi} or \acs{qspi}. Later in the last year of my apprenticeship I'd like to develop a whole \acs{dmm} on my own, but with a different approach as standard ones like these from Fluke. For example, I want to make the \acs{dmm} rechargeable and modernize it a bit. 
\\
To realize this project I'm going to use the following tools: Altium Designer, STM32-CubeIDE, LaTeX, TouchGFX.
