\section{Project Planning}
\label{sec:Project Planning}

\subsubsection{Cost}
I've already bought two \acs{devboard}s one of them stays at \acs{tbz} and the other is at home. One of these boards was paid by Mr. Malacarne. Further expenses from the \acs{pcb} will be paid by me and shouldn't exceed about 50 CHF, as the \acs{hw} isn't that complicated.

\subsubsection{Tools}
To realize this project I will mainly use, the \acs{sw} STM32CubeIDE with \acs{hal} and Altium Designer. The documentation is written in LaTeX in VSCode. And I'm planning to order the \acs{pcb} on JLCPCB and I will populate and reflow the PCB at ETHZ, where I'm also allowed to use the measurement equipment for the HW tests.

\subsubsection{When}
The most time of the project I will work at home because it's a rather big project to execute in one semester. I will also have much time in the fall holidays to work on it.


\subsection{KW39 \& 40}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write introduction
    \item Planning: Cost, Tools, When, Why
    \item Create project diagram (learning process)
    \item ''Pflichtenheft''
    \item Documentation: Top bar as in EN-Poster
    \item Make a \acs{hw}-Digram for the Extension \acs{pcb}.
    \item Make the schematic of the Extension \acs{pcb}. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Part to measure voltage.
        \item Part to measure current.
        \item Part to measure resistance.
        \item Part to measure capacitance.
        \item Addressable LEDs.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Start with the Layout of the Extension \acs{pcb}.
\end{itemize}
