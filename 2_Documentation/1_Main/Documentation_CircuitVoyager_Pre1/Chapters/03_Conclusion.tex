\section{Project Start}
I've noticed that it was quite hard for me to start with the project. There are so much topics to imply, that it can get overwhelming and very emotional. I've also underestimated the time needed to set up the documentation LaTeX files and the whole planning. It can be demotivating if you're spending a lot of time and in the end didn't really start with the project. But later I was able to start the project without much trouble.

\section{HW development}
I've learned much in this project part. Mainly this was Altium Designer, as this was my first complete project I've realised in Altium Designer. This also leaded to some not nicely solved solution. All components for example haver their own properities and this leads to a unreadable BOM.

But in the end I've also noticed, that the dataflow (that usually should go from left to right) goes in the wrong direction. This had already started in the HW-Chart and therefore also ended up in the schematic.

I've also used Draw.io one of the first times and by now it looks very promising. It's much easier and more straight forward than MS Visio. Everthing just works as intended.
